# Primitives

Packages that are found here are primitive components that are building blocks, or utilitarian in nature. These packages are not neccesarily "plug-and-play" components but more so components that provide an intentional functionality. Some of these components may contain basic focus styling for accessibility. Otherwise, these components are intended to be used either on there own, or as part of a more robust component.
