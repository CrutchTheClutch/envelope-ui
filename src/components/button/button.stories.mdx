# Badge

Let's define a story for our `Badge` component:

<Story name="positive">
  <Badge status="positive">Positive</Badge>
</Story>

We can drop it in a `Preview` to get a code snippet:

<Preview>
  <Story name="negative">
    <Badge status="negative">Negative</Badge>
  </Story>
</Preview>

We can even preview multiple stories in a block. This
gets rendered as a group, but defines individual stories
with unique URLs and isolated snapshot tests.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Test">
    <Button>Test</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>
