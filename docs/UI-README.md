# UI

These packages are `ui` components heavily inspired by `@radix-ui` and designed to be used with `tailwindcss`. Many components are primitive in nature, but can also offer "common-sense" defaults in terms of functionality and styling. If a component offers default styling, there will be a `Root` equivalent component that omits this custom functionality and style. When utilizing `Root` components, sometimes other pieces will be required to emulate similar functionality as the fully built component.
